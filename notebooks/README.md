# Notebooks
Directory for .ipynb-files for interactive exploration of the data and plotting.
We often use the workflow:
1. Explore data in notebook
2. Package the code into proper functions (still in notebook)
3. Move the code into proper python-packages (under bike_share/...)
4. Call the packaged code from the notebook (effectively the notebook is only an entry-point, used for plotting and eda but no real reusable code there.)
